        KG hub template for tools to generate knowledge graphs for projects
        
        Documentation
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        This template could be used for data ingestion for varied sources.
        
        **Components**
        
        - Download: The [download.yaml](download.yaml) contains all the URLs for the source data.
        - Transform: The [transform_utils](kg_converter/transform_utils) contains the code relevant to trnsformations of the raw data into nodes and edges (tsv format)
        - Merge: Implementation of the 'merge' function from [KGX](https://github.com/biolink/kgx) using [merge.yaml](merge.yaml) as a source file.
        
        **Utilities**
        
        The code for these are found in the [utils](kg_converter/utils) folder.
        
        - NLP using [OGER](https://github.com/OntoGene/OGER)
        - [ROBOT](https://github.com/ontodev/robot) for transforming ontology.OWL to ontology.JSON
        
        **Examples Included**
        
        Thes examples have download links and transform codes from other projects.
        
        - Drug Central: Sampled from [kg-covid-19](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-covid-19). Code located [here](kg_converter/transform_utils/drug_central)
        - Ontology: Sampled from [kg-covid-19](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-covid-19). Code located [here](kg_converter/transform_utils/ontology)
        - Traits: Sampled from [kg-microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe). Code located [here](kg_converter/transform_utils/traits)
        - Example Transform: Boilerplate code for transforms. Code located [here](kg_converter/example_transform).
        
        The [merge.yaml](merge.yaml) shows merging of the various KGs. In this example we have ENVO, CHEBI, NCBITaxon and the Traits KGs merged.
        
        **Implementation**
        
        [Use this template](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template/generate) to generate a template in the desired repository and then refactor the string `kg_converter` in the project to the desired project name. 
        
        **Setup**
        
        `python setup.py install` and `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
